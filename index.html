                                        Mystic is a passion project that I have been working on for the last year. It is
                                        a custom engine with a built-in editor
                                        that is the playground for all of my engine and tool obsessions. Below, I will
                                        expand on some of the most notable

                                        Scripting is a very important part of any Game Engine. And for Mystic, I wanted
                                        to design a system that allows a creator to iterate quickly without reloading
                                        the whole engine, but still allows the user to run the game code inside of the
                                        editor.

                                        To do this, I implemented a hot-reloadable GameCode module that can be
                                        debugged and changed while the editor is running. This works by injecting a
                                        separate GameCode DLL into the engine runtime during execution. A user can then
                                        click the Hot-Reload button to have the engine rebuild the GameCode binary and
                                        reinject it into the runtime.

                                        components that exist in a separate hot-reloadable DLL, I needed to implement
                                        type reflection. This is something that C++ does not have built-in, so my
                                        solution was to create a tool that parses through custom scripts and builds out
                                        a dictionary of types, then generates code that the engine can use to
                                        access these types safely for scene serialization and display inside the editor.

                                            ComponentArrays are a custom array of components that are all of the same
                                            type. They are packed together in memory so that when the cache fetches one
                                            of them, it is likely to also prefetch the next several in the array. This
                                            means that when a system loops over entities (and their components), it
                                            will already have the components cached for the next entity in the loop.
                                            This saves us a massive amount of CPU cycles when compared to the typical
                                            game engine that incurs an excessive amount of cache misses because
                                            it doesn't pack data.

                                        I wanted to
                                        prove to myself that I could make one and I wanted to gain a deeper

                                            an extensible system that allowed Notifiers to register their notification
                                            stream and render notification events as they pleased, ensuring seperation
                                            of concerns between individual notifiers and the notifications themselves.
                                            My team was very excited about this addition, and it moved cleanly through
                                            code review.

                                            In order to make sure it wasn't too easy for players to traverse the whole
                                            map, and to add a sense of acheivement to the game, I implemented a buyable
                                            debris system that made players spend experience to open up different parts
                                            of the map. This system included linked debris, where buying removal of one
                                            debris would remove another debris that allowed access to the same zone.

                                            implemented a collectable resource system. This system used a custom
                                            spawning volume to randomly spawn resources in each zone and
                                            allowed the player to pick them up in order to craft new weapons and items.

                                            One of my biggest acheivements was the implementation of a second game mode
                                            that was PvP focused. This gamemode operates like a tactical shooter (CS:GO)
                                            and pits players against each other instead of against enemies. I spent a
                                            significant amount of time a week before the final presentation to implement
                                            this gamemode and surprised my team with it with ample time for code review
                                            and QA. This gamemode was a hit within my team and with the other groups
                                            that tested our game.

                                        In this project, I have made use of Epic's Gameplay Ability System (GAS) which
                                        they use in Fortnite and Paragon. I use GAS by applying gameplay
                                        abilities to items that a player can hold. When the player has an item in their
                                        hand, they can execute the ability tied to that item with their "Use" key.
                                        Players can switch hotbar items by using the "1", "2", and "3" keys, and access
                                        their inventory with the "Tab" key. Currently, I have three player abilities
                                        implemented and one enemy ability.

                                        In my CSC 484 (Game AI) class at NC State University, I was tasked with creating
                                        a procedurally generated area that consisted of larger areas (rooms) connected
                                        by smaller areas (hallways) in Processing (with Java). We were given some
                                        examples of simple approaches to take such as using Poisson Disks and recursive
                                        subdvision, but I had a specific goal in mind, which was to emulate the dungeons
                                        used in games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

                                        My solution to the problem starts by creating rooms randomly around the given
                                        area. My algorithm takes a configurable number of attempts to place rooms of
                                        varying size inside the area. If any room is within a configurable distance from
                                        another room, then the room is thrown out and we try again.

                                        The next thing I did is run a Delaunay Triangulation over the center points of

                                        recognition, and they work by ensuring that no point x is inside of the
                                        circumcircle created by connecting points a, b, and c into a triangle.

                                        I used them to ensure that hallways were never extremely long and spanning
                                        across multiple rooms. In short, they had the affect of making adjacent rooms in
                                        close proximity only connect to each other. If a set of rooms passed the
                                        triangulation, I added the edges between each room to a weighted (by length)
                                        graph so that I could keep track of connections between rooms.

                                        Next, I created a Minimum Spanning Tree out of the graph in order to cut down on
                                        the amount of edges between rooms. But, I noticed that Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
                                        seemed to have slightly more than a simple minimum spanning tree, so I added a
                                        configurable parameter that allowed for a percentage of extra edges to be added
                                        on top of the MST.

                                        Finally, I used the list of edges to create hallways between rooms. Hallways in
                                        Pokemon Mystery Dungeon always are split into horizontal and vertical sections,
                                        so I made them randomly start going horizontally or vertically, then switch when
                                        they reached the correct x or y value.

                                        To represent and render the game world, I split up the world into groups of
                                        blocks called <i>Chunks</i>. These chunks are 16x64x16 and serve to limit the
                                        amount of work that has to be done when changes occur in the world. When a block
                                        updates inside one of the chunks, I only have to re-generate the mesh for that
                                        chunk and potentially neighboring chunks.

                                        To create the mesh for a single chunk, I take a lot of shortcuts to speed up the
                                        process. One shortcut is to only add mesh for faces of blocks that have a
                                        transparent block next to them. This increases efficiency by ~100x. I also take
                                        shortcuts in the amount of data I send to the GPU. I pack all of the data for
                                        each triangle into a single integer before sending it, then I unpack it in the
                                        GPU before doing work. This saves on 192 bytes per block face. Which comes out
                                        to tens of thousands of bytes saved per chunk.

                                        One of the most important parts of making a Voxel Engine is making sure the
                                        Render thread is not stalled by the large amount of work done to load chunks
                                        into the world. To solve this problem, I created a Job System that holds a queue
                                        of work orders and completes them on separate threads.
                                    </p>

                                        One way this Job System is used is when we are generating meshes for chunks.
                                        This is an expensive task that can't be done on the main thread. Below is an
                                        example of a call to the Job System to queue up work that should be done. Notice
                                        also, that when work is completed, we use a thread-safe queue to hold the
                                        output.

                                        Later, we sync the output on the main thread, so it can be rendered properly.

                                        Networking is one of the more recent additions to BossCraft. To add networking
                                        capabilities to the game, I used the <a href="http://www.raknet.net/">Raknet</a>
                                        library. This took care of all of the low level networking work so I could focus
                                        on just the data I send between the server and multiple clients.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        The biggest piece of data I send from the server to the client is chunk data. To
                                        do this, the client requests chunks that they don't have or need to be updated,
                                        and the server fulfills those requests and sends those chunks to the client.
                                        Chunks are compressed using Run Length Encoding before being sent to minimize
                                        the size of network messages.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Because all of the work done by the server to load chunks and generate chunk
                                        messages is done on different threads, all outgoing network messages are handled
                                        by a central thread-safe queue that is checked once per game update.

                                        whether it be to re-write it completely, or to make small additions over time.
                                        Currently I am working on adding different types of mobs to the game.
                                        Implementing
                                        this will be where I see the biggest mileage from the ECS architecture, as
                                        pathfinding is an expensive operation. Beyond that, I want to work on the
                                        lighting
                                        and rendering, so that my game approaches the visual level of Minecraft.

                                        I want to get this game to a place where I can log on with my friends and get

                                        feedback over long play sessions.
