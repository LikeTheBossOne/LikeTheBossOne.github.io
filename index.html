                                        This was a project I completed as part of CSC 481 (Game Engine Foundations) at
                                        NC State University. In this project, I created an extensible 2D Game Engine
                                        complete with scripting with JavaScript, Networking with ZMQ, a custom replay
                                        system, and graphics with SFML. For each iteration of the project, I received
                                        the highest grade possible by completing the Graduate Level Objectives along
                                        with the Undergrad objectives. For the final iteration of the project, I had to
                                        prove the extensibility of my engine by implementing a second game with it. I
                                        chose to implement the classic game "Asteroids".

                                        To start the games, you will need to first run the EngineServer, and then the
                                        Client. Both games are networked and fully LAN multiplayer.

                                        For networking, I used ZeroMQ which is a C Library for networking. I decided to
                                        implement a dummy-client solution for networking that required my client to only
                                        gather input and send the input to the server, then render the state of the game
                                        based on messages from the server. I used a combination of a REQ/REP socket and
                                        a PUB/SUB socket to allow two-way communication between multiple clients and the
                                        server.

                                        In this networking architecture, the client has two threads. One for
                                        rendering and receiving input, and the other for receiving messages from the
                                        Server. When the client receives a message, it updates its internal GameObject
                                        state which basically consists of dummy objects that only have a texture, a
                                        transform, and a shape.

                                        The server is what does all of the work in this architecture. It has two threads
                                        as well (but it could be expanded to a pool of multiple for dealing with
                                        multiple clients). The servers worker thread updates the state of the game each
                                        frame and publishes the updated state in JSON format to all listening clients at
                                        the end of
                                        each frame. This state contains the positions of every object, their shapes, and
                                        a reference to a texture. The server's other thread is always waiting for client
                                        messages and raises an Event on the EventManager that the InputManager
                                        subscribes to for handling the input.

                                        I implemented replays by simply recording starting state of the world, then the
                                        current user inputs and deltaTime at the beginning of each tick in a
                                        ReplayTick object which is added to a queue. Then playback is implemented by
                                        consuming each ReplayTick during each regular game tick. When
                                        this happens, the server runs normally and recreates all the Events that
                                        happened during that time organically. Thus, instead of having to save every
                                        single event that happens, I only have to save the inputs, and all the events
                                        will be reproduced. This saved me a significant amount of space as saving only
                                        inputs and deltaTime takes only 8 bytes per tick, whilst saving the events on
                                        each tick will likely take at least 40 bytes per event.

                                        maximize performance by minimizing cache misses. It works by packing data in
                                        memory to take advantage of cache prefetching. This makes
                                        iterating over data, instead of objects, massively more performant.

                                            Components are data-only structs. Each entity has a set of component
                                            instances related to it that define its data. When components types are
                                            registered, each type has a unique id assigned to allow entities to register
                                            for components by type.

                                            macro to define the components that they operate on. This is registered with
                                            the SystemManager on System initialization.

                                            All Components are registered to the ComponentManager, where they are

                                            ComponentArrays are a custom array of components that are all of the same
                                            type. They are packed together in memory so that when the cache fetches one
                                            of them, it is likely to also prefetch the next several in the array. This
                                            means that when a system loops over entities (and their components), it
                                            will already have the components cached for the next entity in the loop.
                                            This saves us a massive amount of CPU cycles when compared to the typical
                                            game engine that incurs an excessive amount of cache misses because
                                            it doesn't pack data.

                                        As part of CSC 482 (Advanced Game Projects) at NC State University, I was put on
                                        a team with six other students to create a 3D multiplayer game, supporting
                                        Keyboard and Controller, using Unity. We chose to create a Zombie Apocalypse
                                        FPS, and we received great feedback from the teaching staff and our sponsors

                                            the Character Movement and Physics that the game would be built on for the

                                            <b>Setup Networking and ensured Multiplayer-first approach</b>:
                                            I was in charge of researching and implementing a networking solution for my
                                            team. I chose to use Photon PUN instead of the Unity solution because the
                                            Unity solution does not provide the responsive fidelity necessary for an FPS
                                            Game. I created the initial prototypes for networked characters and educated
                                            my team on how to implement networking and best practices.

                                            <b>Extensible Notification System</b>:
                                            Partway through the project, I identified the need for a notification system
                                            that would alert the players of things that were happening. So I implemented
                                            an extensible system that allowed Notifiers to register their notification
                                            stream and render notification events as they pleased, ensuring seperation
                                            of concerns between individual notifiers and the notifications themselves.
                                            My team was very excited about this addition, and it moved cleanly through
                                            code review.

                                            In order to make sure it wasn't too easy for players to traverse the whole
                                            map, and to add a sense of acheivement to the game, I implemented a buyable
                                            debris system that made players spend experience to open up different parts
                                            of the map. This system included linked debris, where buying removal of one
                                            debris would remove another debris that allowed access to the same zone.

                                            To go along with the sense of acheivement provided by unlockable zones, I
                                            implemented a collectable resource system. This system used a custom
                                            spawning volume to randomly spawn resources in each zone and
                                            allowed the player to pick them up in order to craft new weapons and items.

                                            One of my biggest acheivements was the implementation of a second game mode
                                            that was PvP focused. This gamemode operates like a tactical shooter (CS:GO)
                                            and pits players against each other instead of against enemies. I spent a
                                            significant amount of time a week before the final presentation to implement
                                            this gamemode and surprised my team with it with ample time for code review
                                            and QA. This gamemode was a hit within my team and with the other groups
                                            that tested our game.

                                        abilities to items that a player can hold. When the player has an item in their
                                        hand, they can execute the ability tied to that item with their "Use" key.
                                        Players can switch hotbar items by using the "1", "2", and "3" keys, and access
                                        their inventory with the "Tab" key. Currently, I have three player abilities
                                        implemented and one enemy ability.

                                        In my CSC 484 (Game AI) class at NC State University, I was tasked with creating
                                        a procedurally generated area that consisted of larger areas (rooms) connected
                                        by smaller areas (hallways) in Processing (with Java). We were given some
                                        examples of simple approaches to take such as using Poisson Disks and recursive
                                        subdvision, but I had a specific goal in mind, which was to emulate the dungeons
                                        used in games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

                                        My solution to the problem starts by creating rooms randomly around the given
                                        area. My algorithm takes a configurable number of attempts to place rooms of
                                        varying size inside the area. If any room is within a configurable distance from
                                        another room, then the room is thrown out and we try again.

                                        recognition, and they work by ensuring that no point x is inside of the
                                        circumcircle created by connecting points a, b, and c into a triangle.

                                        I used them to ensure that hallways were never extremely long and spanning
                                        across multiple rooms. In short, they had the affect of making adjacent rooms in
                                        close proximity only connect to each other. If a set of rooms passed the
                                        triangulation, I added the edges between each room to a weighted (by length)
                                        graph so that I could keep track of connections between rooms.

                                        Next, I created a Minimum Spanning Tree out of the graph in order to cut down on
                                        the amount of edges between rooms. But, I noticed that Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
                                        seemed to have slightly more than a simple minimum spanning tree, so I added a
                                        configurable parameter that allowed for a percentage of extra edges to be added
                                        on top of the MST.

                                        Finally, I used the list of edges to create hallways between rooms. Hallways in
                                        Pokemon Mystery Dungeon always are split into horizontal and vertical sections,
                                        so I made them randomly start going horizontally or vertically, then switch when
                                        they reached the correct x or y value.
